You are tasked with determining whether there exists an integer k within a given sequence a1,a2,…,ana1​,a2​,…,an​, 
where each element of a is either 1 or 2. 
This integer k must satisfy the condition that the product of the first k elements is equal to the product of the remaining elements in the sequence. 
If multiple such kk exist, you should output the smallest one.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
(1≤t≤100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n
(2≤n≤1000).

The second line of each test case contains n
integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤2).

Output

For each test case, if there is no such k, print −1.

Otherwise, print the smallest possible k.
