Write a c++ program to take |n| numbers from user a1, a2, ..., an and find their sum.
|x| implies absolute of x, if x=-5 |x|=5, if x=5 |x|=5.

Constraints:
-10^5<=n<=10^5
-10^9<=ai<=10^9

Solution to the code is provided in solution.cpp file, but the code is failing in some test cases, DEBUG it.
Note: Printing the strings is not causing any error, the sum is coming wrong.
