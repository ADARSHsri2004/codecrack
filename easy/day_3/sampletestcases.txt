Note
In the first test case, we can only make c=[2,2], thus the answer is 2.
In the second test case, since all values are distinct, the answer must be 1.
In the third test case, the arrays c we can make are [1,2,1,2], [1,2,2,1], [2,1,1,2], [2,1,2,1]. We can see that the answer is 2 when we choose c=[1,2,2,1].
