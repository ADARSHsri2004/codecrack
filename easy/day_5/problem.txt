You've been tasked with a problem where you're given an array of positive integers. The objective is to modify this array through a series of operations so that each consecutive pair of elements doesn't have a relationship where one divides the other. 

To achieve this, you're allowed to increment any number in the array by 1, and you can perform this operation up to twice the length of the array.

The input consists of multiple test cases. For each case, you'll receive the length of the array followed by the array itself.

Your task is to output, for each test case, the modified array that satisfies the given condition.

Rest assured, a valid solution exists within the constraints provided. If there are multiple valid solutions, you can output any of them. 

Let's dive into solving this intriguing problem!
