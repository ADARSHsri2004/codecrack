Note
In the first test case, the array [4,5,6,7]
 can be achieved by applying 2
 operations to the first element, 1
 operation to the second element, 3
 operations to the third element, and 1
 operation to the last element. The total number of operations performed is 7
, which is less than the allowed 8
 operations in this case.

In the second test case, the array [3,2,3]
 can be achieved by applying two operations to the first element. Another possible resulting array could be [2,3,5]
, because the total number of operations does not need to be minimum.

In the third test case, not applying any operations results in an array that satisfies the statement's property. Observe that it is not mandatory to make operations.
