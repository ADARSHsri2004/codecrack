Riley, a mischievous character with a knack for yo-yo tricks, seeks to annoy his friend Anton by strategically throwing two yo-yos in Anton's room. Anton's room is depicted as a grid with rows and columns, with Anton standing at a specific position within the room. 

The task at hand is to determine the optimal placement for the two yo-yos so that Anton, while picking them up and returning to his initial position, travels the maximum possible distance. Anton can move only to adjacent cells vertically or horizontally.

Given the dimensions of the room and Anton's initial position, the challenge is to find the coordinates where Riley should throw the yo-yos.

The input consists of multiple test cases, each providing the room's dimensions and Anton's position.

Your objective is to output the coordinates for the yo-yo throws that maximize Anton's travel distance.

In scenarios with multiple solutions, any valid solution can be provided.

Let's devise a plan to identify these optimal yo-yo throwing locations for Riley's mischievous scheme.
