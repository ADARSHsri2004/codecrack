Bluemin, an ardent television aficionado, meticulously records his daily viewing schedule. His agenda consists of n shows, each delineated by its start time  li  and end time  ri .

Armed with two televisions, Bluemin ponders whether he can accommodate all the shows simultaneously. 

However, he must adhere to a crucial stipulation: while he can enjoy two distinct shows concurrently using the two TVs, he cannot overlap shows on a single TV if one ends precisely as another begins.

To assist Bluemin in his scheduling conundrum, ascertain whether his two TVs suffice to cover all  n  shows.

Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of shows.
Each of the next n lines contains two integers li and ri (0 ≤ li < ri ≤ 10^9) — starting and ending time of i-th show.


Output
If Bluemin is able to check out all the shows using only two TVs then print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Assess Bluemin's capability to navigate through his shows, ensuring an optimal viewing experience with the available resources.
