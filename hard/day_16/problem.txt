Bluemin and his pal, the clever robot Bluemin++, are enthusiasts of tackling thrilling math challenges.

One fine day, Bluemin++ concocted numbers n and x and inscribed the following equation on the board:

                                        n & (n+1) & … & m=x,

Here, the symbol & represents the bitwise AND operation. Then, Bluemin proposed to his friend Bluemin to determine the smallest possible value for m (where m≥n) such that the equation on the board holds true.

Unfortunately, Bluemin found himself unable to crack this puzzle mentally, prompting him to seek assistance from a computer. Swiftly, he scripted a program and unveiled the solution.

Can you venture into this perplexing problem?

Input: 

Each examination comprises numerous test instances. The initial line entails the count of test cases t(1≤t≤2000). Subsequently, each test case description ensues.

The solo line of every test case embraces two integers n, x (0≤n,x≤10^18).

Output: 

For each test instance, unveil the minutest conceivable value of m such that the equation holds true.

If no m exists satisfying the equation, denote it as −1 instead.

It's evident that if the requisite m does exist, its value does not surpass 5⋅10^18.
