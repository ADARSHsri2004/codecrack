Imagine a structure resembling a pyramid, where each number is calculated as the exclusive OR (XOR) of the two numbers directly below it. For instance, consider the following pyramid: [refer to pyramid.png]

Your task is to determine the topmost number of this pyramid given the bottom row.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer, n, denoting the size of the pyramid.
Following this, the second line consists of n integers, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the bottom row of the pyramid.

Output
Output a single integer representing the topmost number of the pyramid.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= a_i <= 10^9
