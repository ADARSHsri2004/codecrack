You are presented with an array 'a' consisting of 'n' integers. Your task is to determine the count of pairs of indices (i,j) where i<j and the difference between aj and ai equals the difference between j and i.

Input:

The first line contains an integer 't' (1≤t≤10^4) denoting the number of test cases.

Following this, for each test case:

    - The first line holds an integer 'n' (1≤n≤2⋅10^5) representing the size of the array.
    - The second line consists of 'n' integers a1, a2, ..., an (1≤ai≤n), representing the elements of the array 'a'.

It is assured that the total sum of 'n' across all test cases does not surpass 2⋅10^5.

Output:

For each test case, output the count of pairs of indices (i,j) satisfying the condition aj−ai=j−i.
