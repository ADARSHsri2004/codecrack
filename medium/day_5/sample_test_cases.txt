Note
In the first example you can remove any element with the value 2
 so the array will look like [5,1,2,2]
. The sum of this array is 10
 and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements (5=1+2+2
).

In the second example you can remove 8
 so the array will look like [3,5,2]
. The sum of this array is 10
 and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements (5=3+2
). You can also remove 2
 so the array will look like [8,3,5]
. The sum of this array is 16
 and there is an element equals to the sum of remaining elements (8=3+5
).

In the third example you cannot make the given array good by removing exactly one element.
