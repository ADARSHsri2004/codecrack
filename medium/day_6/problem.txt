You're faced with a task involving repairing a long stick composed of \( m \) segments, with some segments broken and needing repair. You have an infinitely long repair tape at your disposal. Your objective is to determine the minimum total length of tape needed to cover all the broken segments.

However, you're constrained by time and can only cut at most \( k \) continuous pieces of tape to cover all the broken segments. Additionally, it's acceptable to cover non-broken segments, and overlapping tape pieces are permitted.

The input includes \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), denoting the number of broken segments, the total length of the stick, and the maximum number of tape pieces allowed, respectively. It also provides the positions of the broken segments.

Your task is to output the minimum total length of tape pieces required to cover all the broken segments while adhering to the given constraints.

Let's devise a plan to efficiently compute this minimum total length of tape.
